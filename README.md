## Notes
This project was created before I had a strong understanding of GitHub and its many uses. For a more accurate representation of my current understanding of GitHub, please visit my calculator-application repo.

To avoid licensing issues with middleware assets, only the original source code written by me for this project has been provided in this repository.
